# Memory-Game([demo](https://maryb16.github.io/Memory-Game/))
This is the 3rd project that I did for Udacity Front-End program during my  Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship.

## Description
This is a simple memory card game. All the cards are laid face down and the user has to click each card in order to find its match. The game finishes once all the cards have been matched.

## Live Demo
You can test the app [here](https://maryb16.github.io/Memory-Game/)

### Features
* *Star rating system.*
The player starts off with three stars. The more moves he makes, the less stars he will receive at the end of the game.
* *Timer.*
Once the player clicks a card for the first time, a timer starts that tells him how much time has passed since the start of the game.
* *Move counter.*
Every time the player clicks a card, one move is added to his move counter. Clicks made during the animation or after the cards have matched are not taken into consideration.
* *Game-end PopUp.*
Once the player matches all the cards, a popUp will appear that tells him how many stars he has won, how many moves it took him, how much time the game took and will also offer the possibility to start  a new game.

## Known issues
The game does not work well in landscape mode on phones or tablets. It is recommended that the player keeps his device in portrait mode
It does not work on internet explorer
